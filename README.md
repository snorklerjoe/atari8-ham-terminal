# atari8-ham-terminal
A serial terminal program for the atari 8-bits to suit my needs for amateur radio.

There are many terminal programs for the atari that are great, but here is what I want to implement here (we'll see what I get to):
- [ ] Customizable ATASCII -> ASCII mapping
- [ ] Customizable RS232 settings (All 850 interface module settings, but in a menu!)
- [ ] Saving a log to a file, cassette, or printer
- [ ] Other settings, like disabling keyboard beep or having it beep on tx
- [ ] Customizable multi-page scrollable buffer without saving log


## And, maybe in the future, ...

APRS Mode:

- [ ] APRS packet parsing (maybe using serial-connected GPS also?)
- [ ] APRS packet plotting on a map
- [ ] APRS packet logging to a file or printer & plotting any log on map

- [ ] APRS digipeater?
